A simple tetris clone made with Godot Engine.
There are potential bugs and some features to implement. 

Features:
Tetris and Pentris (5-block piece) game mode
Ghost piece
Wall kicks
Garbage-filled rows
Ability to hold pieces for later
Hardcore mode (no ghost piece, random row scrambling)- needs polishing
Touch controls for mobile devices
